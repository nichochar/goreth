Go and Ethereum exploration. It starts with https://goethereumbook.org/en/client-setup/

If running against local, we assume a ganache server is running:
```bash
ganache -m "hole symptom crater bring army industry link later fabric hotel asthma pupil"
```

To run the remote client, simply compile and run: `go run .`. If you want to run against a local ganache client, run `go run . -local`.
